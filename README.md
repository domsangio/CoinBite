# CoinBite
Hopefully a successful project that will make me moneys

# Main Idea
The main idea of this is to create an algorithm with/without ML to track and look
at historical data of Crypto (later to be stocks ideally) and find the best time
to buy/sell.

This will then be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with the intent to later move to the cloud
